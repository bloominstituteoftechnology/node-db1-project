### Task 1: Project Setup and Submission

Your assignment page on Canvas should contain instructions for submitting this project. If you are still unsure, reach out to School Staff.

### Task 2: Minimum Viable Product

### 2.1 Write Basic SQL Queries

Visit [SQL Try Editor at W3Schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/Sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_select_all) using Chrome and build the queries below. Once they work copy them to the `queries.sql` file at the root of the project.

- Find all customers with postal code 1010. Returns 3 records.
- Find the phone number for the supplier with the id 11. Should be (010) 9984510.
- List first 10 orders placed, sorted descending by the order date. The order with date 1997-02-12 should be at the top.
- Find all customers that live in London, Madrid, or Brazil. Returns 18 records.
- Add a customer record for _"The Shire"_, the contact name is _"Bilbo Baggins"_ the address is _"1 Hobbit-Hole"_ in _"Bag End"_, postal code _"111"_ and the country is _"Middle Earth"_.
- Update _Bilbo Baggins_ record so that the postal code changes to _"11122"_.

**Clicking the `Restore Database` button in the page will repopulate the database with the original data and discard all changes you have made**.

### 2.2 Build a RESTful API for the Accounts Resource

We have provided some records inside the "accounts" table of the `budget.db3` database. You can restore the database (even after deleting the database) by running the following command:

```js
npm run resetdb
```

#### Accounts Schema

| field  | data type        | metadata                                            |
| ------ | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| id     | unsigned integer | primary key, auto-increments, generated by database |
| name   | string           | required, unique                                    |
| budget | numeric          | required                                            |

#### Write Model Functions

- Write the following db access functions inside `api/accounts/accounts-model.js` using Knex:

  - `getAll` resolves to an array of accounts (or an empty array)
  - `getById` resolves to an account by the given id
  - `create` resolves to the newly created account
  - `updateById` resolves to the updated account
  - `deleteById` resolves to the deleted account

- Here is a cheatsheet for working with SQLite with Knex:

```js
db('foo-table') // returns a promise that resolves to an **array** with all records in the table
db('foo-table').where({ role: 'Student', active: true }) // resolves to an **array** of all records that satisfy the where
db('foo-table').where('name', 'Mary') // is an alternative for when there is just one where condition
db('foo-table').where('id', 7).first() // will resolve to the **record** we want (if the id is unique for a table) or undefined
db('foo-table').insert({ bar: 'baz' }) // resolves to an **array** containing the **ids of the records** inserted into the table
db('foo-table').where('id', id).update({ bar: 'new bar' }) // resolves to the **number of records** affected by the update
db('foo-table').where('id', id).delete() // resolves to the **number of records** affected by the delete
```

#### Write Middleware

- Write the following middlewares inside `api/accounts/accounts-middleware.js`:

  - `checkAccountPayload` returns a status 400 with if `req.body` is invalid:

    - If either name or budget are undefined, return `{ message: "name and budget are required" }`
    - If name is not a string, return `{ message: "name of account must be a string" }`
    - If the _trimmed_ name is shorter than 3 or longer than 100, return `{ message: "name of account must be between 3 and 100" }`
    - If budget is not a number, return `{ message: "budget of account must be a number" }`
    - If budget is a negative number or over one million, return  `{ message: "budget of account is too large or too small" }`

  - `checkAccountId` returns a status 404 with a `{ message: "account not found" }` if `req.params.id` does not exist in the database

  - `checkAccountNameUnique` returns a status 400 with a `{ message: "that name is taken" }` if the _trimmed_ `req.body.name` already exists in the database

### Write Accounts API

- Write CRUD for the `accounts` resource, using the middlewares and model functions above wherever appropriate:

  - `[GET] /api/accounts` returns an array of accounts (or an empty array if there aren't any).
  - `[GET] /api/accounts/:id` returns an account by the given id.
  - `[POST] /api/accounts` returns the created account. Leading or trailing whitespace on budget `name` should be trimmed before saving to db.
  - `[PUT] /api/accounts/:id` returns the updated account. Leading or trailing whitespace on budget `name` should be trimmed before saving to db.
  - `[DELETE] /api/accounts/:id` returns the deleted account.

- Manually test your endpoints with a REST client like `Insomnia` or `Postman` to check they are working as expected.
- Test your endpoints automatically by running `npm test`.

#### Important Notes

- You are welcome to create additional files but **do not move or rename existing files** or folders.
- Do not alter your `package.json` file except to install additional libraries or add additional scripts.
- In your solution, it is essential that you follow best practices and produce clean and professional results.
- Schedule time to review, refine, and assess your work.
- Perform basic professional polishing including spell-checking and grammar-checking on your work.

### Task 3: Stretch Problems

The following exercises **require research**, the concepts needed to complete them have not been covered in class yet.

- Run more queries.

  - Find a query to discover how many different cities are stored in the Customers table. Repeats should not be double counted. Should be 69.
  - Find all suppliers who have names longer than 20 characters. Returns 11 records.
  - Add a `query string` option to the `GET /api/accounts` endpoint. The `query string` may contain `limit`, `sortby` and `sortdir` keys. If these keys are provided, use these values to limit and sort the `accounts` which are selected from the database. Reference the docs for sorting and limiting in [knexjs.org](http://knexjs.org/).

  ```js
  // sample req.query object
  {
    limit: 5,
    sortby: 'id',
    sortdir: 'desc'
  }
  ```
